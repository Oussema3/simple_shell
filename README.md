### ⛽What is Shell⛽

    ▷In computing, a shell is a computer program which exposes an operating system's services to a human user or other program. In general, operating system shells use either a command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI), depending on a computer's role and particular operation. It is named a shell because it is the outermost layer around the operating system

    ▷Command-line shells require the user to be familiar with commands and their calling syntax, and to understand concepts about the shell-specific scripting language (for example, bash).

    ▷Graphical shells place a low burden on beginning computer users, and are characterized as being easy to use. Since they also come with certain disadvantages, most GUI-enabled operating systems also provide CLI shells.

## Compilation and Testing✅

1) Clone repo to your local directory

   ◆ https://github.com/Oussema3/simple_shell.git

2) Start up simple_shell, compile using

   ◆ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh

3) Start the shell

   ◆ ./hsh

4) Example Output

   ◆ $ ./hsh
   
    ($) /bin/ls
   
    hsh main.c shell.c
   
    ($)
   
    ($) exit
   
    $
